# Vangers Binary Scripts Assembler

### This is a toolset for building and testing scripts of the [Vangers](https://github.com/Kranx/Vangers).

I made it because the original game's assembler is pretty slow, and also, you need a modified version of the game to use it.
Many cool things are stored in these scripts, and I want more people to be able editing them.

### Actually, it cannot assemble original game's scripts.

Raw Vangers scripts have an awful structure, like a multiline strings, quoted script keywords, etc.
This is why there is a VBSA Formatter. It solved some problems, but others I had to edit by myself.
All these formatted scripts (and dictionaries for VBSA) are located in the /data/ directory.
